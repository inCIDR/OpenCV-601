Exercise 1
A CV Mat is an N-dimensional matrix that stores the intensity of all pixel data. It can be written and read with imwrite and imread and outputted as a image with a color scheme (RGB,HSV,etc)

Exercise 2
look at baboon colorimage.png for the images
1. RGB is pretty standard, HSV and YCrCb seem to have a clear image each (V,Y), but have 2 matte shades to help give the image texture. Kind of hard to describe them if you're used to RGB.
2.
[ 96 173 165]
[162 130  91]
[ 87 113 173]
rgb ranges from 0-255 for all 3
YCrCb ranges from 16-235 for Y and 16-240 for Cr and Cb
HSV ranges from 0-179 for H and 0-255 for S and V

Exercise 4
look at baboon threshold.png for the images
1. Thresholding seems to get rid of certain colors beyond a spectrum. It is useful to show facial features/outlines of an object in the image. The threshold values change how much of the picture is seen. It seems like Binary is the colorswap of Band Thresholding. Adaptive seems very clear, removing a lot of fine details and leaving a very crisp image. Semi Thresholding darkens the image and isn't very clear.
2. Binary thresholding, while maintaining image integrity, is somewhat hard to distinguish borders, as it includes a lot of unnecessary detail if you want to identify something.
3. Adaptive Thresholding has crisp borders, thus makes it much easier to identify facial features like eyes,nose, and mouth.
